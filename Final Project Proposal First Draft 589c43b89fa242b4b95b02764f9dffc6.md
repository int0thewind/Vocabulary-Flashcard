# Project Purpose and Motivation

Having the capability to wield a capacious amount of vocabulary has been proved to have direct positive impact on a person's success, yet so far as we have seen, not many vocabulary memorizing app has incorporated the best ways to memorize, which are studying by adding time/Ebbinghaus forgetting curve/synonyms/prefix/suffix. We decide to create a web app to allow user to add/export vocabulary, automatically fetch definitions from authoritative dictionaries by their APIs, and learn/manage their vocabularies by a variety of different methods.
