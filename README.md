# Vocabulary Flashcard

CS 242 SP21 Final Project, co-developed by Hanzhi Yin and Gary Liu.

## Quick regards on branch Structure

`dev` branch has pre-written code, all by Hanzhi. This allow both of us to free from low-level configurations. 

## Tech Spec

* NextJS with Firebase
* TypeScript
* `yarn` as NodeJS package manager

## File Structure

`pages` and `public` directory are NextJS reserved. All other scripts are under `src`.

ESLint, Firebase, TypeScript, and NodeJS configs are in the root directory.

## Environment Setup

Acquire Merriam Webster Collegiate Dictionary/Thesaurus and Oxford Dictionary API keys.

Paste them in `.env.local.sample` and rename it to `.env.local`.
